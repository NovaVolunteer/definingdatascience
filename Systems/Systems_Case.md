# Systems CASE

**General Description:** This assignment is an extension of the NVIDIA stock price case study discussed during class and your experience in our “LABS 9: GPU” assignment. For this assignment you will select a time period, 1/1/2019-1/1/2023 or 1/1/2023-present, and study the GPU market during that time. Your goal is to explain what was going on with GPUs and as a result the NVIDIA stock price. You will present your findings in a short video, 5 minutes long.  

 
**Preparatory Assignments:** In class case study and LABS 9: GPU 

**Why am I doing this?** GPUs play a major role in the practice of data science, in particular in training machine learning models. This case study extension is your chance to go deeper and understand the history of the use of GPUs. You will explore the market demands for GPUs and in doing so gain a larger understanding for GPUs. 

 

**Course Learning Objective Alignment:** Identify the hardware and software components of a computer and describe their function 

**Course Learning Objective Alignment:** Describe the different scales of computer operation 

 

**What am I going to do?** First you will select a time period to study, either the four years from 2019-2022 or Jan 2023-present. Then you will research the role GPUs played in the global market during that time and understand the use cases driving their sales. From this research you will be able to understand the behavior of the NVIDIA stock price. Once you have a coherent explanation you will write a short script that takes 5 minutes to deliver and produce slides as necessary to accompany that script. Finally, you will produce a 5-minute video where you deliver your presentation. That video is your deliverable and is submitted via link in the canvas assignment. [if you are a youtuber or an aspiring youtuber this is the assignment for you] 

 

**Tips for success:**

Start early, this project involves a little research, a little writing, a little visualization, and recording your presentation. 

Don’t worry about the production value of the presentation. Recording it via zoom or on your cell phone camera is completely acceptable. The key is that you speak clearly and can be heard and that any visualizations you show are clearly viewable. [but if you want to, go for nice value, we can introduce you to some people in the media studies space] 

Pick the time window that interests you. If you pick 2019-2023 you will be digging into the supply chain and economics of the pandemic. If you are tired of that, then pick the last three months. 

  

**How will I know I have succeeded?** I will meet spec when I follow the criteria in this rubric. 

| Spec Category | Spec Details |
|---------------|--------------|
| Formatting    | - 5 minutes <br /> - Video format (typically mp4 or other appropriate similar format) <br /> -Submit a link to your video which is stored in the cloud, (YouTube is acceptable or zoom / one drive / google drive / etc.) <br /> -Submit your script via canvas <br /> |
| Script        | - Goal: Your script is the guide for your presentation. This document should contain all the points you want to make and be sequenced to tell a story. <br /> - The submission format is pdf, you may create it using the program of your choice <br /> - You do not have to read the script verbatim, it is a guide. <br /> - You can research guides on how to create a script for a short video if this is new for you. <br /> - Make sure you do your research first and make an outline. <br /> - The goal is a 5 minute presentation, take note of your speaking cadence and information to present and determine an appropriate length that will correspond to 5 recorded minutes. <br /> |
| Visualization | - Goal: Your visualizations should support your script. When you are telling your story this element provides support to your ideas and should help the viewer to understand. <br /> - You have the freedom to use whatever mechanism you want. <br /> - A slide deck is a great tool to use. <br /> - Cite the sources you use. (details below in the references section.) <br /> |
| Video         | - Goal: This will be a short (5min) video with your explanation of the GPU market demand and the NVIDIA stock price during your time window. <br /> - You will upload a link to canvas <br /> - Submit a link to your video which is stored in the cloud, (YouTube is acceptable or zoom / one drive / google drive / etc.)  <br /> - Include a link in the description to your script  <br /> |
| References    | - GOAL: Present the references you used when doing the research for your presentation. <br /> - Include a slide in your visualization  <br /> - Use [IEEE Documentation style](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf) <br /> - *.wikipedia.org is not permissible but *.wikimedia.org is (if you are not familiar with the distinction please ask for assistance) <br /> |
