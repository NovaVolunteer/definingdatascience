# Analytics LOOK

**General Description:** This assignment is a traditional mathematics style assignment. It continues to explore important mathematics concepts touched on in the analytics section. The first part is to review the List of Symbols and Preface in “Mathematics for Machine Learning”. This is the same book that you read from in READ-10. 

**Why am I doing this?** Part of data science is getting your hands dirty with the math behind something you are implementing. This assignment gives a window into that process. If you look at advances in Data Science, e.g. google search, they often come from implementing a mathematical concept. This assignment focuses on key ideas from linear algebra and probability, both foundational concepts in machine learning algorithms. These are fundamental tools of analytics and practicing them in this way is great practice for implementing models in the future. 

**Course Learning Objective Alignment:** Understand the mathematics behind the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” 

**What am I going to do?** Step one is to skim through the problems in the assignment and identify jargon that you do not know. Then read the corresponding sections, spending time on understanding the jargon from the problems. Finally solve the problems listed from the “Exercises” section of the chapter. 

**Reading:** List of Symbols & Preface (pages ix – xiii), Chapters 2-7 as needed 

**Problems to Solve:**  
- Chapter 2: 2.4 
- Chapter 3: 3.3, 3.4 
- Chapter 4: 4.1 
- Chapter 5: 5.2, 5.4 
- Chapter 6: 6.1, 6.4  
- Chapter 7: 7.1 
 

**Tips for success:**

- Expect to not know what things mean before you start. Expect to learn. 
- Read sections several times. Even Professor Alonzi didn’t understand it all the fourth time he read it. 
- When stuck, think deeply for a couple minutes, and then walk away. Reengage after laughing at something. 

**How will I know I have succeeded?** I will meet spec when I follow the criteria in this rubric.
