    "## Lab 1 - Mastermind entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "DS 1001 - Spring 2023 - Professors Wright and Alonzi\n",
    "\n",
    "Due: End of lab period (or later that day)\n",

    "Submission format: Word doc or PDF summarizing your findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Descripition:** This lab is designed to introduce the basic concepts behind information gain and entropy. Mastermind is a game were through a series of questions one player tries to determine a \"code\" created by another player. In doing so the value of asking questions that provide a high level of information will become paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparatory Assignments - None\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why am I doing this?** In order to gain a better understanding of information gain and entropy through hands on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What am I going to do?** Work with a partner or group of three and alternate playing the game. At the onset of each game the code-maker should calculate the entropy of the chosen pegs for the \"code\". The code-breaker should note the results of the game . This should include whether the code was broken or not and the number of rounds used. Try to be the code-maker and breaker at least 3 times. The code-maker should intentionally use very different types of \"code\", this should impact how the game is played.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Note the range of entropy for binary cases is 0 to 1 for more than 2 classes it is 0 to log~2~ *k*, where *k* is the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer these questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What combinations of pegs (code) seemed to be harder to break?\n",
    "2.  Did your approach to asking questions change as you played?\n",
    "3.  Describe where in the game information gain is being presented?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips for success:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Don't worry about winning, instead think about what is happening during game play.\n",
    "-   Work as a team with your group.\n",
    "-   Try to document the process used right at the start of the lab, don't wait till after you have played to start taking notes.\n",
