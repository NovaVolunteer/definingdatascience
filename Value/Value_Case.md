# Value Case Study

This case study will have you review the evolution of Open AI as an organization and the conditions that led to the company modifying its status as a non-profit entity to a company that allows for-profit generation and shareholder growth but on a limited basis.

Below is Open AI’s original charter as a nonprofit organization, review and note the key takeaways from this original organizational ideal.

Answer the following questions:
- What did they state as organizational goals?
- Why do you think Open AI organized as a nonprofit company?
- Why might this decision be important for the field of AI/Data Science?
- How did they generate their original funding for the organization?

Contrast that with the statement and the article below.

Example article of them going private: https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/

Answer the following questions:
- Why do you think they made this decision?
- Does it still align with the company's original charter?
- Was this an ethical decision?
- Given this decision, what do you believe the future of the organization will look like?
- Is it important for AI technologies to be developed in the “Open”, why or why not?
